Regarding feature 1
- While not being a feature that manipulates JabRef's internal structure, it is a simple and clean extension related to the program's main functionality.

Miguel Real 55677:
Regarding feature 1.1
- Good proof of concept for the feature, understandably not as polished as would be ideal given time constraints.

João Vieira, 56971:
Regarding feature 2
- Shame you didn't mnanage to implement this feature, would've been a very cool addition. Either way good effort.
