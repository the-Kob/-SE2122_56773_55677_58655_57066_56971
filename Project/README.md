### Description 

Our sprints are **_1 week_**, being the corresponding Scrum Master responsible to update all the documentation regarding their sprint (Burndown Charts, Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Scrum Board).

A lot of our project is being organized through Notion. You can access it [here](https://perpetual-catshark-375.notion.site/The-S-hina-Team-65ed77aebec945d0864a6c74a7e1a34b).
Most of our discussion happens there through comments on the tasks each of us does, so each of us updates the reviewlogs of the tasks with the comments and conversations that happen around them. You can verify the reviews on the comments of each task.
