    Regarding the Dead Code code smell (code smell #10)

    "I don't think this can be classified as a case of dead code. This class is used, namely in /src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/autosaveandbackup/AutosaveManager.java, and /src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/dialogs/AutosaveUiManager.java.
    In the first class, the AutosaveEvent object is used as a parameter to the listen() method, which needs it in order to identify the type of event triggered (in this case, an AutosaveEvent).
    In the second class, the AutosaveEvent object allows us to place an event into the event bus to which the listen() method subscribes to.
    In short, even though this class is empty, it is not dead code, since it serves a very specific purpose." -19:55 -23/11

    "I disagree, yes this class is used, I mentioned it my description but the reason I classified this as dead code is that the class is empty and adds no new functionality to the application. Its only purpose is to satisfy verifications, therefore believe this should not exist, at very least it could be something like a interface.A empty class is basically useless" -20:15 -23/11

    "Forgot to mention this in my previous comment, but the path provided for the AutosaveEvent.java class is incorrect. It should be SE2122_55677_56773__56971_57066_58655/src/main/java/org/jabref/model/database/event/AutosaveEvent.java
Regarding your reply, I don't see your point. The class serves a purpose, the code will not work without it. The functionality it provides is working as an event type, necessary for 2 other methods. And it cannot be an interface, the class is instantiated in a method inside the AutosaveManager class. This project uses the com.google.common.eventbus package, which allows the creation of event subscriber methods and event producing methods. Those methods require an event object that can be posted to the event bus. Check out the following link for documentation on this package, maybe it will help clear things up: https://guava.dev/releases/16.0/api/docs/com/google/common/eventbus/package-summary.html" -20:20 23/11

    Regarding the Switch Statements code smell (code smell #10)
    
    "Indeed, the code is quite bloated with all those ifs. It seems like it could be simplified with some refactoring." -10:55 04/12

    Regarding the "String literals should not be duplicated" code smell (code smell #12)
    
    "This is definitely a recurring problem in the JabRef project, the solution you presented seems adequate. Good work." -12:50 05/12
