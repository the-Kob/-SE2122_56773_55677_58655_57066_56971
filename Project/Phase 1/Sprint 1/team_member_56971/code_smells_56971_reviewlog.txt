Regarding the Dead Code code smell (code smell #10)

"I don't think this can be classified as a case of dead code. This class is used, namely in /src/main/java/org/jabref/logic/autosaveandbackup/AutosaveManager.java, and /src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/dialogs/AutosaveUiManager.java.
In the first class, the AutosaveEvent object is used as a parameter to the listen() method, which needs it in order to identify the type of event triggered (in this case, an AutosaveEvent).
In the second class, the AutosaveEvent object allows us to place an event into the event bus to which the listen() method subscribes to.
In short, even though this class is empty, it is not dead code, since it serves a very specific purpose." -19:55 -23/11
