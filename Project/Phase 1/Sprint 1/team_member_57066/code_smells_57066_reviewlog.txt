  Regarding the Data class code smell
  
  "This class cannot simply be transformed into a record since there are exceptions in its' constructor, and it would hinder its' extensibility. 
  Also data classes aren't a problem as is, it normally stems from the repeated use of their data in other classes in similar ways, which means that that logic should be put into   the "data class" itself. 
  Try to analyse if that's the case and if it's possible to move the logic." -19:30 22/11

  Regarding the Dead code/speculative generality code smell
  
  "I agree with your assement, we should delete this snippet as it has no use for this aplication and it makes code look more bloated. 
  If it is needed at a future point of project it should  be added then not before." -19:54 22/11
