  Regarding the Data class code smell
  
  "This class cannot simply be transformed into a record since there are exceptions in its' constructor, and it would hinder its' extensibility. 
  Also data classes aren't a problem as is, it normally stems from the repeated use of their data in other classes in similar ways, which means that that logic should be put into   the "data class" itself. 
  Try to analyse if that's the case and if it's possible to move the logic." -19:30 22/11
  
    My response:
    "Those are good points. I also noticed that I missed an original method in the class itself. I'll proceed to change the code smell." -21:04 22/11
    
  "Yep, the long method code smell looks good." -22:49 22/11

  Regarding the Dead code/speculative generality code smell
  
  "I agree with your assement, we should delete this snippet as it has no use for this aplication and it makes code look more bloated. 
  If it is needed at a future point of project it should  be added then not before." -19:54 22/11

Team member 55677 (Miguel Real):
  Regarding the Large Class code smell
  
    "I agree with this assessment, from examining the BibEntry class I got the impression it is a giant of a class that does way too much. 
    I think the keyword/field related behaviour classes is a good idea since it splits the responsibilities of the original class." -23:05 22/11
