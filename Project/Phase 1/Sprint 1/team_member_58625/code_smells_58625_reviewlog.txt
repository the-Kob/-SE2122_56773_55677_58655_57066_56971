  Regarding the Duplicate Code code smell
  
  "I agree with your assessment and solution but I have somehing to point out. I think that when choosing between which of the 2 methods you want to delete, you should choose the one with the name that best describes the variable in the context it is used. 
  If only both are equally well named methods should you give the choice to a coin flip." -00:10 23/11
