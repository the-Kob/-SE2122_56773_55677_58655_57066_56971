  Regarding Long Parameter List:
  "Yes I agree that parameter lists of these 3 constructors are too long, I also think both your proposed fixes will probably be necesserary in some cases. For example in the GuiPreferences.java constructor, even if we bundle the position and size parameters into its own class, we will still have a paramters list of size 6, which is still too long."

  Regarding Comments/Dead Code:
  "It seems the developers taking care of this feature may have forgotten about the commented code, which is an unfortunate but common problem in larger projects. I agree with the problem itself and the proposed solution, and mark this task as Complete." -18:13 23/11

  Regarding Long Method:
  "I like this assessment of the code smell. Besides being valid due to the 143 lines that the method is composed of, your fix seems like a good approach to fixing it."
